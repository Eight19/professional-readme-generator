# Professional README Generator

## Description

The Professional README.md Generator was created using the Inquirer package and is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. This easy to use application provides the layout and format of a professional README.md, which, in turn, allows a user to create a professional README.md with ease. My motivation for this project was to create a simple and pain-free way to make a professional README.md for a project.
 

## Usage

The Professional README.md Generator prompts questions that allows the data they enter to build a Professional README.md. This saves the user time and allows more time to work on the project.

## Installation 

This application was installed via the inquirer package.
